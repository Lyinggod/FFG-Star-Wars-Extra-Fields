- **Grouped Fields:** Enter a **Group Name** to cluster related fields together.

#### Ordering Fields

The display order of fields on an actor is determined by their sequence in the _Custom Fields_ dialog. Reorder fields effortlessly using the drag-and-drop feature.

## Formatting

To enhance the visual layout of your actor sheets, you can create empty spaces by leaving the **Field Name** blank. This feature is useful for organizing information and improving readability, as demonstrated in the example images above.

## API or lack there of

the fields are stored in the actor in _flags.lgs-extra-fields-for-star-wars.extraFields_ as an object:

```
[
    {
        "group": "Sanity",
        "name": "Curret",
        "value": 0
    },
    {
        "group": "Sanity",
        "name": "Threshold",
        "value": 0
    }
]
```
## Important Considerations

### Renaming Groups or Field Names

Be cautious when renaming **Group Names** or **Field Names**. Doing so will reset any stored data on the actor to 0. Ensure that you intend to reset the data before making such changes.

### Incompatibilities

This module may not be compatible with other modules that modify the default actor template. If you experience issues, check for conflicts with other installed modules and consult their documentation for compatibility information.
