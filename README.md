# FFG-Star-Wars-Extra-Field
This module was written with AI as I am not much of programmer.

This is a module for the FFG Star Wars system for foundry. 

It allows for adding of additional fields to actors, placed below the derived values.

Fields are defined via Configuration Settings and the _Custom Fields_ dialog.

**Group Name:**
This groups Field Names into a single group.

Leave _Group Name_ empty to create a non-group field. The system will assign a "placeholder" value which will be visible when the _Custom Field_ dialog is re-opened.

The order of the fields on the actor is determined by the re-order of the fields in the _Custom Fields_ dialog, which can be order by drag and drop.

# Formating

Leaving **Field Name** blank will result in a empty "space" being created which can used for formatting as shown in the example pictures, above.

# Renaming Groups or Field Names
Renaming either _Group Names_ or _Field Names_ will result in any data store on the actor being reset to 0

### Incompatibilities
This may not work with modules that change the default actor template
